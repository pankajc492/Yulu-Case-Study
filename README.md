                      🚲 Yulu Bike Rental Demand Analysis
📌 Objective
. Analyze the key factors affecting bike rental demand for Yulu, a micro-mobility service in India.

. Identify patterns in user behavior influenced by weather, season, temperature, and day type.

📊 Tools & Technologies
. Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy, Statsmodels)

. Google Colab

. Statistical Tests (T-Test, ANOVA, Chi-Square)

. EDA & Data Visualization

🔍 Data Preprocessing
. Converted date and categorical variables for accurate analysis.

. Detected and labeled outliers in numerical attributes like humidity and windspeed.

. Cleaned missing data and ensured attribute types were appropriate for statistical testing.

📈 Visual Analysis
. Univariate: Histograms and distribution plots for humidity, temperature, and seasonal frequency.

. Bivariate: Boxplots and countplots comparing rental count across seasons and weather conditions.

. Heatmaps & Pairplots: Identified correlations between variables like temperature and rental volume.

🧠 Statistical Testing & Insights
. T-Test: No significant difference in rental behavior between working and non-working days.

. ANOVA: Rental demand varies significantly across seasons and weather types.

. Chi-Square Test: Weather is dependent on season, confirming that demand must be managed seasonally.

📌 Key Business Insights
. Season & Temperature: Rental demand is highest during Fall and Summer; lowest in Winter.

. Weather: Clear weather days see the most rentals; poor weather drastically reduces demand.

. Day Type: Working days do not statistically impact rentals — demand is steady across the week.

. Strategic Planning: Inventory and pricing should be aligned with weather and seasonal forecasts.

✅ Recommendations
. Scale up fleet availability in Fall and Summer; reduce during Winter.

. Use weather forecasts to manage dynamic pricing and resource allocation.

. Focus promotions around clear weather days and weekends for maximum utilization.

. Use the insights from dependency between weather and season for predictive planning.
